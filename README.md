# header-source-side-by-side README

This extension will attempt to open a related file for instance myFile.cpp / myFile.h in a tab group to the left and right. Running the command again will swap the cursor location from these two groups. This is similar to the way Xcode handles showing the implementation along side the header file.

## Features

- Open the header and implementation side-by-side.

## Requirements

No special requirements

## Extension Settings

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `header-source-side-by-side.do`: Open a tab group to the right or left and swap to the source / implementation

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1
